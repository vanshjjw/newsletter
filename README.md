## What I'm Trying to Build

Okay, so I get way too many email newsletters and never read them. The idea here is to build a simple app where I can dump all those subscriptions without messing up my main inbox.

In short: Turn annoying newsletters into a personalized, quick-to-read feed. Mix-up content as well to make it dynamic and not feel like literature review.

The user interface is key here.

## Implementation Ideas

1. The app gives me a special email address (like `user@app.whatever`)

2.  I sign up for newsletters with this address (keep my actual inbox clutter-free)

3.  The backend grabs those emails, tries to pull out the actual articles, and then (the important part!) uses some AI magic to hopefully create really short summaries/headlines. This creates the feed.

4.  The frontend is a simple React app (mobile-first!) that shows these summaries like a TikTok/Reels feed, so I can scroll through the useful bits quickly.

5. I want to do something cool with the feed is displayed, the order of content and how to provide more info when the user wants to read more.


## Questions

*   How best to parse email content without AI?

*   User accounts complexity?

*   What's the best way to implement the "read more" functionality?

*   What's the best way to actually receive the emails (SendGrid, Mailgun, self-hosted)?
